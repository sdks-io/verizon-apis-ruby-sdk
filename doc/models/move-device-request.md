| `filter` | [`DeviceFilter`](../../doc/models/device-filter.md) | Optional | Specify the kind of the device identifier, the type of match, and the string that you want to match. |
| `custom_fields` | [`Array<CustomFields>`](../../doc/models/custom-fields.md) | Optional | Custom field names and values, if you want to only include devices that have matching values. |
| `devices` | [`Array<AccountDeviceList>`](../../doc/models/account-device-list.md) | Optional | Up to 10,000 devices that you want to move to a different account, specified by device identifier. |
| `group_name` | `String` | Optional | The name of a device group, to only include devices in that group. |
| `carrier_ip_pool_name` | `String` | Optional | The pool from which device IP addresses will be derived in the new account. If you do not include this element, the default pool will be used. |
